                                    <h2>The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>
                                    <p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the
                                        same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or
                                        remember complicated shortcode syntax. That’s the spirit behind the inserter—the
                                        <code>(+)</code> button you’ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse
                                        all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are
                                        able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich
                                        editing and publishing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your
                                        posts that you didn’t know about. Here’s a short list of what you can currently
                                        find there:</p>
